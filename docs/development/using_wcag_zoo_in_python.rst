Using WCAG-Zoo validators in python
===================================

As WCAG-Zoo is a native Python 3 library, it can be imported and used in Python 3 scripts easily.

Once installed from ``pip`` (``pip install wcag_zoo``), load any of the validators
and call ``validate_document`` on an instance as shown in the example below.


.. literalinclude:: scripts/python_lib_wcag.py
   :language: python
